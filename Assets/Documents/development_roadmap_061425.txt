## Development Roadmap for No More Engine

### Phase 1: Deterministic Foundation (2-3 weeks)
**Goal: Establish rock-solid deterministic simulation**

#### Immediate Goals:
1. **Centralized Time System**
   ```csharp
   // Create SimulationTimeComponent singleton
   - Fixed timestep management
   - Frame counter
   - Tick rate configuration
   ```

2. **Deterministic System Ordering**
   - Define explicit update order for all systems
   - Create custom SystemGroup hierarchy
   - Add frame boundary markers

3. **Validate Determinism**
   - Expand DeterminismTestTool to test gameplay scenarios
   - Add automated tests for common operations
   - Create determinism regression suite

### Phase 2: State Management (2-3 weeks)
**Goal: Enable state capture and restoration**

#### Immediate Goals:
1. **Snapshot System**
   ```csharp
   // Core features needed:
   - ISnapshotable interface for components
   - SnapshotManager for state capture
   - Efficient binary serialization
   ```

2. **Input Recording**
   - Store input history with frame numbers
   - Replay system for testing
   - Save/load replay files

3. **State Rollback**
   - Implement rollback to previous snapshots
   - Test with simple scenarios
   - Measure performance impact

### Phase 3: Core Gameplay (3-4 weeks)
**Goal: Make it actually playable**

#### Immediate Goals:
1. **Combat System**
   - Health/damage components
   - Hit detection using existing collision
   - Basic attack animations (even if debug visuals)

2. **Projectile System**
   - Object pooling for projectiles
   - Spawn/despawn lifecycle
   - Different projectile types

3. **Win Conditions**
   - Stock/life tracking
   - Match end detection
   - Proper game over flow

### Phase 4: Network Foundation (3-4 weeks)
**Goal: Prepare for multiplayer**

1. **Input Prediction**
   - Local input prediction
   - Remote input buffer
   - Delay compensation

2. **State Synchronization**
   - Delta compression
   - Reliable state updates
   - Connection management

3. **Rollback Integration**
   - Combine all systems
   - Handle conflicts
   - Performance optimization

## Immediate Priority Actions (This Week)

1. **Create Time System**
   ```csharp
   public struct SimulationTimeComponent : IComponentData
   {
       public uint currentTick;
       public fix deltaTime;
       public fix tickRate;
   }
   ```

2. **Fix Hard-coded Values**
   - Replace all `0.016f` with time system
   - Create GameConstants ScriptableObject
   - Centralize magic numbers

3. **Implement Basic Spawning**
   ```csharp
   public partial struct GameplaySpawnerSystem : ISystem
   {
       // Spawn projectiles during gameplay
       // Use object pooling
   }
   ```

4. **Add Jump Mechanic**
   - Simple up velocity on button press
   - Ground detection
   - Complete the control loop

5. **Create System Ordering**
   ```csharp
   [UpdateInGroup(typeof(FixedStepSimulationSystemGroup))]
   [UpdateAfter(typeof(InputGatheringPhase))]
   [UpdateBefore(typeof(PhysicsPhase))]
   ```

## Success Metrics

- **Week 1**: Time system integrated, determinism tests pass consistently
- **Week 2**: Can capture/restore game state, jump mechanic works
- **Week 3**: Basic combat with projectiles spawning/destroying
- **Month 2**: Full replay system, state rollback working
- **Month 3**: Local multiplayer prototype with rollback

## Pro Tips

1. **Test Determinism Early and Often**
   - Run automated tests after every major change
   - Use the DeterminismTestTool as your canary

2. **Keep Systems Small**
   - Each system should do one thing well
   - Makes debugging determinism issues easier

3. **Document State Dependencies**
   - Note which components affect which others
   - Critical for rollback implementation

4. **Profile Everything**
   - Measure performance impact of each feature
   - Rollback is performance-critical

Start with the Time System today - it's the foundation everything else builds on. Once that's solid, you'll have confidence to tackle the more complex features.
